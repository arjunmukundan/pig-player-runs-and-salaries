# Correlating maximum player salaries with runs
Correlating baseball players' salaries and runs, using Pig, to see if highly paid athletes score the highest runs. This is only to experiment if earning the highest salary that year, made them get the highest runs as well. 
The data is taken from 'Batting.csv' and 'Salaries.csv', from the zipped folder containing csv files with different baseball statistics, available at: http://hortonassets.s3.amazonaws.com/pig/lahman591-csv.zip
